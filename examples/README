Examples
--------

pthr_eg1_*

	This is a very basic example webserver which simply
	prints out the query string and a few other details
	like request headers when you connect to it.

	Run it as:

	./pthr_eg1_echo -p 8002

	and then try connecting to it (eg. with lynx, netscape, etc.):

	http://localhost:8002/something

pthr_eg2_*

	This is a slightly more advanced example. This webserver
	will serve flat files (only). It can be used for benchmarking,
	profiling/optimizing the library, or even as a very simple
	production webserver.

	It needs to be started as ``root'' because it chroots and
	changes its user ID for security reasons.

	All configuration is by way of command line arguments. Try
	typing ``./pthr_eg2_server --help'' for a complete list.

	This webserver is capable of exploiting the full power
	of SMP machines.

	To start it (as root):

	./pthr_eg2_server -p 8003 -r /home/httpd/html -u nobody

	If you have more than one processor, then you need to
	use the ``-n'' argument to tell it how many processors
	you have.

	Tip for benchmarking: use a lot of client machines
	connected through a full-duplex ethernet switch to
	the server. On each client machine, run a recursive
	``wget'' to download a large number of files, eg:

	wget -r http://server:8003/

rws

	RWS is a full-featured webserver built on top of pthrlib.
	It is distributed separately. You can get it from
	http://www.annexia.org/freeware/rws/
