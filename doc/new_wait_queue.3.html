into how wait queues are implemented. This may help if you
find there are tricky race conditions in your

Originally, wait queues were implemented using underlying
Unix pipes. This worked (to some extent) but the overhead of
requiring one pipe (ie. one inode, two file descriptors) per
wait queue made this implementation unacceptably
heavyweight.</td></table>

Wait queues are now implemented using a simple hack in the
reactor which will be described below.</td></table>

Wait queues are subtle. Consider this example: Threads 1, 2
and 3 are sleeping on a wait queue. Now thread 4 wakes up
the queue. You would expect (probably) threads 1, 2 and 3 to
each be woken up and allowed to start running. However,
since this is a cooperatively multitasking environment, it
may happen that thread 1 wakes up first, does some work and
then goes back to sleep on the wait queue, all before
threads 2 and 3 have woken up. With a naive implementation
of wait queues, thread 4 might end up waking up thread 1
*again* (and even again after that), never waking up threads
2 and 3 and ultimately starving those threads.</td></table>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="10%"></td><td width="90%">
To avoid this situation, we might consider two possible
alternatives: either when thread 1 goes back to sleep, it
goes to sleep on a 'different' queue, or else thread 4 might
take a copy of the wait queue and delete the queue before it
wakes any of the threads up.</td></table>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="10%"></td><td width="90%">
Another nasty situation which might arise in real life is
this: Again, threads 1, 2 and 3 are sleeping. Thread 4 wakes
them up. Thread 1, while processing its work, happens also
to wake up the same wait queue. What should happen to this
second wake-up event? Should it be ignored? Should it wake
up threads 2 and 3? Should it wake up any other threads
which happen to have gone to sleep on the queue after 1, 2
and 3? Or perhaps some combination of these?</td></table>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="10%"></td><td width="90%">
The solution that we have come up with is as follows. A wait
queue consists of a simple list of threads which are
sleeping on it. When a thread wishes to sleep on the wait
queue, it is added to this list, and it switches back into
the reactor context. When a thread wishes to wake up all
sleepers, it: (a) copies the list of sleeping pseudothreads
into its own private space (b) clears the list of sleeping
pseudothreads (c) registers a prepoll handler to run which
will wake up (ie. switch into the context of) each of these
threads in turn (d) continues to run to completion. A thread
which wishes to wake just one pseudothread works similarly
except that it only copies (and removes) a single item off
the list.</td></table>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="10%"></td><td width="90%">
Note various invariant conditions: A thread cannot be
entered on the wait queue sleeping list more than once
(because it cannot call sleep_on when it is already
sleeping). For similar reasons, a thread cannot be entered
on any of the multiple lists at the same time. This implies
that a thread cannot be woken up multiple
times.</td></table>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cols="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="10%"></td><td width="90%">
The reader should satisfy themselves that this algorithm is
free of races, and solves all the problems outlined above.
In addition, it has the desirable property that wake_up*
never sleeps.</td></table>
